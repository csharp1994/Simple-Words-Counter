# Simple-Words-Counter

Scans a text file and creates a sorted list of each word and the number of times it occurs.
Sorted by decending value of occurances and secondarily sorted alphabetically by word.

Punctuation and the words "of", "the", "to", "and", and "for" are ignored.

Creates an excel spreadsheet with the sorted list.
