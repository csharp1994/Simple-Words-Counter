# Simple-Words-Counter

A very basic JFrame GUI to demonstrate a document scanning word counter. It accepts a custom string or can default to using the declaration of independence. It outputs an excel spreadsheet with the word count results.

Result are sorted by decending value of occurances and secondarily sorted alphabetically by word.

Punctuation and the common words "of", "the", "to", "and", and "for" are ignored.
